# rust-playground
Just a few rust very simple programs I wrote while learning the [Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html).

Some are slight variants of the samples found in the official Rust documentation, others are the exercises that are suggested at the end of some chapters.

# Requirements
You should have installed the rust toolchain.

# Compilation
Each program can be ran by going into each directory and typing `cargo run`.
